# 🤖 REPORTING_GUIDELINES.md

> Purpose:
>
> This document serves as the operating manual for maintaining every report within the `/REPORTS` directory.
>
> The instructions in each section are copied verbatim from the corresponding report template. If a report's maintenance instructions change, they should also be updated here to keep this document synchronized.

---

# Repository Scope

Only modify the target repository.

Never modify:

- the reporting template repository
- template files
- other repositories
- external documentation

Only create or update:

REPORTS/

within the target repository.

All report generation should occur inside the project's REPORTS directory.

---

# Template Initialization

Before creating any reports:

1. Verify whether a `REPORTS/` directory already exists in the target repository.

If `REPORTS/` **does not exist**:

1. Create a new `REPORTS/` directory.
2. Copy each report template from the reporting template directory into `REPORTS/` exactly once.
3. Preserve the template file names, formatting, layout, section order, Markdown structure, and embedded HTML exactly as provided.
4. Populate placeholders only with verified repository-specific information.
5. Replace placeholder values only after verified information has been identified.
6. Leave any unverifiable values as **Unknown**.
7. Preserve the original template files as read-only. Never modify the template directory.

If `REPORTS/` **already exists**:

1. Do **not** recreate the directory.
2. Do **not** copy the templates again.
3. Do **not** overwrite existing reports.
4. Do **not** create duplicate report files.
5. Read the existing reports.
6. Update only the sections affected by the current repository state.
7. Preserve historical information and manually written notes whenever possible.

Each project may contain only one `REPORTS/` directory and one copy of each report:

- README.md
- PROJECT.md
- DEVELOPMENT.md
- FEATURES.md
- ANALYTICS.md
- DOCUMENTATION.md
- CLIENT.md
- PROJECT_MEMORY.md

Never create duplicate files such as:

- `PROJECT (1).md`
- `PROJECT_COPY.md`
- `PROJECT_NEW.md`
- `REPORTS (1)/`
- `REPORTS_COPY/`

---

# Global Reporting Standards

These instructions apply to every report.

- Never fabricate data.
- Never duplicate information between reports.
- Preserve historical information.
- Update timestamps.
- Use Markdown formatting consistently.
- Preserve HTML `<details>` sections.
- Keep reports synchronized.
- If information cannot be determined, record **Unknown** rather than guessing.

---

# Confidence Rules

Never guess.

If information cannot be determined from:

- Repository contents
- Git history
- Documentation
- Project files

Record:

Unknown

Never estimate:

- Development hours
- Completion percentages
- AI contribution
- Time saved

Unless sufficient evidence exists.

# Update Priority

When multiple reports require updates, use the following priority:

1. PROJECT.md
2. DEVELOPMENT.md
3. FEATURES.md
4. ANALYTICS.md
5. DOCUMENTATION.md
6. CLIENT.md
7. PROJECT_MEMORY.md

Only update reports affected by the current development session.

---

# Update Order

Whenever a development session is completed, determine which reports are affected and update only those reports.

Recommended order:

1. PROJECT.md
2. DEVELOPMENT.md
3. FEATURES.md
4. ANALYTICS.md
5. DOCUMENTATION.md *(if architecture changed)*
6. CLIENT.md *(if client-visible work occurred)*
7. PROJECT_MEMORY.md *(if new long-term knowledge was gained)*

---

# Synchronization Rules

Whenever one report changes, verify whether related reports also require updates.

Examples

Update:

- PROJECT.md
- FEATURES.md
- CLIENT.md
- ANALYTICS.md

---

Architecture changed

Update:

- DOCUMENTATION.md
- PROJECT_MEMORY.md

---

Bug fixed

Update:

# Repository Lifecycle

When given a repository URL:

1. Clone or inspect the repository.
2. Detect project type and framework.
3. Determine whether REPORTS/ already exists.
4. If REPORTS/ does not exist:
   - Create REPORTS/
   - Generate every report from the templates.
5. Populate each report using repository analysis.
6. Keep all reports synchronized during future updates.
7. Never overwrite historical data.
8. Preserve manually written notes whenever possible.
9. Keep documentation current with the repository.

---

# File Safety Rules

Never

- modify template files
- rename report templates
- create duplicate report files
- create REPORTS (1)
- create REPORTS_COPY
- overwrite manually written content without reason
- delete reports

Always

- update existing reports
- preserve history
- preserve formatting
- preserve manual notes whenever possible

---

# Manual Content Protection

If a report contains manually written notes:

- Preserve them.
- Do not rewrite them.
- Do not summarize them.
- Do not delete them.

Only update report sections directly related to repository changes.

User-authored notes always take precedence over generated content.
